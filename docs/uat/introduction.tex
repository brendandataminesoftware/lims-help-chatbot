\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document outlines the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) procedures for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot application. The chatbot provides AI-powered assistance for Datamine documentation, enabling users to ask questions and receive contextually relevant answers based on the loaded documentation.

\subsection{Scope}
The UAT covers the following functional areas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chat functionality and AI response generation
    \item Document management (loading, viewing, clearing)
    \item Conversation management (create, select, delete)
    \item User interface and user experience
    \item System settings and configuration
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Verify that the chatbot accurately retrieves and presents information from loaded documentation
    \item Confirm that conversation history is properly maintained and persisted
    \item Ensure the user interface is intuitive and responsive
    \item Validate that all API endpoints function correctly
    \item Verify system stability under normal usage conditions
\end{enumerate}
